LAO INSTALLATION HOWTO

Requirements:
-------------

Mandatory:
* cmake
* Perl

Optional
* Bison            => to regenerate CDT/LIB/Declare.pm
* Glpk / Cplex     => to solve linear programs
* Yaml             => to input Minir files to LAO


Building:
---------

Preferred method of building is "out-of-source". This is the method described here.
LAO build system is based on cmake.

  # Create build directory & setup for a target
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../LAO

  # At this point, cmake will complain that several options are not set. These
  # can either be defined by adding '-D<option>=<value' on the cmake line, or by
  # using the cmake GUI, ccmake:
  ccmake .

  # Options are the following
  -DTARGET=<arch>    # required, e.g., "kv3"
  -DFAMILY=<arch family> # required, e.g., "kvx"

  -DGLPK=<path>       # path to glpk install directory, or
  -DGLPK_ENABLED=off  # to turn glpk off

  -DYAML=<path>       # path to yaml install directory, or
  -DYAML_ENABLED=off  # to turn yaml off


  # cmake should then generates makefiles in the build directory. Build LAO using
  make all

  # or, on a multiple core machine
  make -j<num cores> all

Note: all subsequents calls to 'make' can be sped up by using -j<num cores>
this applies to make targets 'all', 'check', etc.


Checking:
---------

  # Self test .tst files can be built and tested using
  make check

  # in the build directory, or in any sub-directory
  make -C CDT check
  make -C ECL/LIR check

  # If all .tst have been built, it is possible to use directly
  make test
  # or equivalently
  ctest

  # The later invocation can be used in verbose mode in any directory to
  # investigate why a self test failed.
  ctest -V
  cd ECl/LIR && ctest -V


LAO Tests
---------

The old/legacy way of testing LAO is through the use of .input.c file produced by
Open64. These files are compiled to .input files.

For this to work, two directories LAO_INPUT and LAO_TRACE should
exist. Directory LAO_INPUT contains .input.c files that must be compiled
against the LAO libraries:

LAO_INPUT
└── st200
    ├── autcor.1.input.c
    ├── autcor.2.input.c
    ├── bassmgt.input.c
    ├── bfilter.input.c
    ├── bitonic.1.input.c
    ...
    └── xxx.input.c

Directory LAO_TRACE contains environment variables settings & reference traces, e.g.

LAO_TRACE
├── default.env
└── st200
    └── default
        ├── autcor.1.trace
        ├── autcor.2.trace
        ├── bassmgt.trace
        ├── bfilter.trace
        ├── bitonic.1.trace
        ...
        └── xxx.trace

Note: the paths to these directories can be changed using ccmake:

  cmake .. -DLAO_TRACE=<path> -DLAO_INPUT=<path>

Environment variables passed to .input files for building .trace files are
defined in .env file. For example, default.env may contain:

  CGO_TRACE=1
  FORCE_ALLOCATION=0
  FORCE_COALESCING=Boissinot,Congruence,Virtualize
  FORCE_CONVERSION=Folding,Cleaning,SemiPruned
  FORCE_SCHEDULING=0
  LIR_TRACE=1
  PFA_TRACE=1
  SCD_TRACE=1

The .input.c files must be compiled with LAO headers. Those headers must first
be 'installed' in the build directory.

  # Install LAO headers files
  make install

  # Then, reference traces can be produced & compared against previous reference
  make traces
  ...
  make tests

  # To clean traces
  make noinputs    # clean .input in
  make clear       # same + remove also .input* files
