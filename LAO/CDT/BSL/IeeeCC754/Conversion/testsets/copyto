!! This file is part of the tool IeeeCC754 or IEEE 754 Compliance Checker.
!! It is a precision and range independent tool to test whether
!! an implementation of floating-point arithmetic (in hardware or
!! software) is compliant with the principles of the IEEE 754-854
!! floating-point standards. You can find out more about the testing
!! tool IeeeCC754 and the syntax and semantics of the test vectors
