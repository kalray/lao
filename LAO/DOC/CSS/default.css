/* default.css -- default style sheet for Ravenbrook web site
 *
 * Copyright 2003 Ravenbrook Limited.
 *
 * 2003-07-04  RB  Designed for new web site layout.
 * 2003-07-09  RB  Split into default stylesheet for all documents and style sheet for web site pages.
 * 2003-07-11  RB  Changed link styles to be independent of the "A" tag.  Safari 1.0 was
 *                 (correctly, I think) highlighting A anchors (i.e., with IDs not HREFs)
 *                 when hovering over them.  Besides, there might be another kind of tag
 *                 that has links.  Read the CSS1 and CSS2 specs and related documents at
 *                 w3.org carefully and fixed things up to be consistent with them.
